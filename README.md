<h1>WolvenKit (for Cyberpunk 2077) Modified GUI </h1>
<em>Forked from https://github.com/WolvenKit/WolvenKit </em>
<p>
  A modified version of Wolvenkit fit to issues I experienced while using the application. Examples include: Unclear dialogues, missing or poorly implemented functionality, and unexplained errors.
  This will focus on the GUI for the application.


  Changes include:
  <ul>
    <li>Rephrase text to clarify what a user needs to do, for example: the export tool doesn't inform the user of where to add files</li>
    <li>Provide more responses in the log view to user actions and reduce error blob spitting</li>
    <li>Identify potentially dead menu items to fix or remove, <s>suspected dead items includes File>>Import>>Import .archive</s> </li>
    <li>Remove 'Continue to Editor' from the home pages, editor is useless without a project</li>
    <li>Attempt to resove issue where dragging files into a project directory can delete it</li>
  </ul>
</p>
